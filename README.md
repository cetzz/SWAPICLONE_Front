Introduction
=====
This is a repository that has a couple pages that showcase my Star Wars API. 

## Dependencies
 - jQuery
 - Animate.css
 - Bootstrap Growl
 - My own SWAPI clone, you can find it here: https://github.com/cetzz/test_LN/

## Installing

 - After installing the SWAPI clone, put the API's Base URL on conf.php as WS_URL. There is an example already there.
  
Done!

## Features

  There is a landing page, and a vehicle and starship page. The Vehicle page searches by ID, the Starship page searches by name or model. 

In reality the api can do both for both, but I wanted to show one for each.

  You can also hover over the results so a new input text appears, and you can decrease or increase the amount of that vehicle by the amount you put in. 

It refreshes in real time, and those numbers are not a mock-up. They come from the API. If you want to check, feel free to input things that are not numbers, or something else.

  The API can also set those amounts, but I had no idea on how to get it into the interface, so I didn't have any use for it.
 
## Can I look at the code and use it?
  If you find something useful, sure! These proyects were made as a test, so both the API and this webpage are an open source proyect.
